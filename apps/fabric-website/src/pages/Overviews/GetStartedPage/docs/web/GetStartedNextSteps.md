Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple React app with an Microsoft UI Fabric React DocumentCard.

As next steps, try using other components like `DetailsLists`, `Callout` etc.

### Other ways to get Fabric React

For advanced scenarios or alternatives to NPM see the advanced documentation in the Fabric React repository.

### Need a component Fabric React doesnâ€™t have?

First, check the Fabric React issue queue or projects to see if your component has already been requested or is being worked on. If you don't see an existing issue or project for the component you're looking for, please file an issue in the repo, and we'll respond if it's being built or on our radar.
