### Prerequisites

All you need to get started with Fabric is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm.

#### Node.js and npm

- Install **Node.js** (supported versions are 8.x through 10.x) from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- For code editing we like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

_You can check your node and npm version by running `node -v` and `npm -v` respectively._

#### create-react-app package

We will use [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) to quickly create a React app.

Once node and npm are installed, type the following command in a console to install the `create-react-app` npm package.

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

#### Visual Studio Code

Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

We will use Visual Studio Code as our code editor for this tutorial. Feel free to use your favorite code editor of choice if you do not want to use Visual Studio Code.
